# Email_Spam_Filter
An AI-powered spam classifier that helps filter unwanted emails using Machine Learning.

### Overview
Sorting through spam emails manually is frustrating. This project is a machine learning-based spam filter that automatically classifies emails as spam or not. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze email content and make predictions with high accuracy.

Features
- Machine Learning-Based Classification – Uses Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes for high accuracy.
- Text Preprocessing – Tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization using NLTK.
- Real-time Predictions – Quickly determines whether an email is spam or not.
- Efficient and Scalable – Can process large datasets with ease.

### Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK
  
### Performance
- Achieved 87% accuracy in detecting spam.
- Reduced manual sorting time by 45%, saving users valuable time.

### Setup & Installation
*Clone the repository:*
- git clone https://github.com/efuayankey/Email_Spam_Filter.git

*InstaLl dependencies:*
- pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk

*Run the model:*
- python spam_filter.py

### Future Improvements
- Implementing deep learning models (LSTMs) for better classification.
- Developing a web-based UI for user-friendly spam detection.
